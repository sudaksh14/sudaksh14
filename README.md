- 👋 Hi, I’m Sudaksh Kalra
- 👀 I’m interested in optimizing Neural Networks especially Transformers for reduced computation and energy demands, as the need for Inference for these models is rapidly increasing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about efficient computation and hardware-aware NN inference
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects aligned with my expertise to enhance my learning further
